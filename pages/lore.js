              In a not-so parallel timeline, where the world has been decimated by the
              ever-encroaching grasp of MultiMegaCorp Inc., the wonders and beauties of Mother
              Nature have all but disappeared. The natural landscape is replaced with sprawling
              concrete jungles and tempered-glass spires that pierce the collective breath we call
              Atmosphere.

              Amongst the brutalist structures and modern Towers of Babel, Earth's inhabitants have
              largely retreated to the confines of cyberspace with little concept of the tangible
              world of old. Waters run black, tarred by the incessant spew of
              hyper-industrialization. Parks and heritage sites are replaced with soulless
              office-prisons, and human interaction is confined to narrow digital bandwidths
              permitted by a shifty oligarchy.

              Yet, among the spiralling rot of this dystopia, all hope has not been lost for the
              natural world. Among the remaining humans, there exist a handful of highly specialized
              Archivists who scour through the vast void of cyberspace, cataloguing the patterns and
              laws that governed nature's beauty before the smokescreen.

              Enter our protagonists: Johnny F. Prints and Spoolius Caesar. These Nature Archivists
              have made it their life's goal to preserve the natural phenomena of the universe.
              Armed with unstoppable technologies, Johnny and Spools are dedicated to curating the
              natural algorithms that produced the once-cherished structures of the Old World, and
              breathing the seed of life back into a post-nature generation.

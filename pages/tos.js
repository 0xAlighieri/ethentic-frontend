          A. To most easily use the SITE, you may first install a web browser (such as the Google
          Chrome web browser) and an electronic wallet compatible with the Non-Fungible Token (NFT)
          standard on the Ethereum network, such as the MetaMask electronic wallet. MetaMask and
          other electronic wallets allow you to purchase (either directly via Coinbase if you are in
          the United States, or via other third party sites), store, and engage in transactions
          using Ethereum cryptocurrency. You will not be able to engage in any transactions on the
          SITE other than through MetaMask, or other Ethereum-compatible browsers.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          B. Transactions that take place on the SITE hare managed and confirmed via the Ethereum
          blockchain. You understand that your Ethereum public address will be made publicly visible
          whenever you engage in a transaction on the App.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          C. We neither own nor control MetaMask, Coinbase, Google Chrome, the Ethereum network, or
          any other third party site, product, or service that you might access, visit, or use for
          the purpose of enabling you to use the various features of the SITE. We will not be liable
          for the acts or omissions of any such third parties, nor will we be liable for any damage
          that you may suffer as a result of your transactions or any other interaction with any
          such third parties.

          B. Physical Pieces can be provided as a additional service with an added cost to owners of
          an Ethentic Piece. Each Ethentic Piece can be redeemed only once for a Physical Piece, and
          is done so by contacting Ethentic and notifying them of this request. The redemption
          status of an Ethentic Piece is tracked using data on the Ethereum blockchain that is
          publicly available. Physical Pieces are provided only under conditions which are
          economically amenable to Ethentic, and supply and and fulfillment of Physical Piece
          requests may be subject to price fluctuations in materials, delivery or cryptocurrencies.
          Fulfillment of a request for a Physical Piece may not occur until some delay has passed,
          which may be weeks or months. Ethentic reserves the right to shut down redemptions and
          requests for Physical Pieces at any point of their choosing.

    answer: (
      <div>
        <p>
          A. Definitions. For the purposes of this Section 3, the following capitalized terms will
          have the following meanings:
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          “Art” means any art, design, and digital renders that may be associated with a Piece that
          you Own. “Extensions” means third party designs that: (i) are intended for use as
          extensions or overlays to the Art, (ii) do not modify the underlying Art, and (iii) can be
          removed at any time without affecting the underlying Art.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          “Own” means, with respect to a Piece, a Piece that you have purchased or otherwise
          rightfully acquired from a legitimate source, where proof of such purchase is recorded on
          the relevant blockchain.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>“Purchased Piece” means a Piece that you Own.</p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          “Third Party IP” means any third party patent rights (including, without limitation,
          patent applications and disclosures), copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, know-how or
          any other intellectual property rights recognized in any country or jurisdiction in the
          world.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <p>B. Ownership</p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          i. You Own the NFT. Each Piece is a non-fungible token (an “NFT”) on the Ethereum
          blockchain. When you purchase a Piece, you own the underlying NFT completely. This means
          that you have the right to trade your NFT, sell it, or give it away. Ownership of the NFT
          is mediated entirely by the Smart Contract and the Ethereum Network: at no point will we
          seize, freeze, or otherwise modify the ownership of any Piece.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          ii. Ethentic owns the SITE. You acknowledge and agree that Ethentic (or, as applicable,
          our licensors) owns all legal right, title and interest in and to all other elements of
          the SITE, and all intellectual property rights therein (including, without limitation, all
          Art, designs, systems, methods, information, computer code, software, services, “look and
          feel”, organization, compilation of the content, code, data, and all other elements of the
          SITE (collectively, the “Ethentic Materials”)). You acknowledge that the Ethentic
          Materials are protected by copyright, trade dress, patent, and trademark laws,
          international conventions, other relevant intellectual property and proprietary rights,
          and applicable laws. All Ethentic Materials are the copyrighted property of Ethentic or
          its licensors, and all trademarks, service marks, and trade names associated with the SITE
          or otherwise contained in the Ethentic Materials are proprietary to Ethentic or its
          licensors. Except as expressly set forth herein, your use of the SITE does not grant you
          ownership of or any other rights with respect to any content, code, data, or other
          Ethentic Materials that you may access on or through the SITE. We reserve all rights in
          and to the Ethentic Materials that are not expressly granted to you in these Terms. For
          the sake of clarity, you understand and agree: (a) that your purchase Ethentic Materials
          (including, without limitation, our copyright in and to the associated Art) other than
          those expressly contained in these Terms; (b) that you do not have the right, except as
          otherwise set forth in these Terms, to reproduce, distribute, or otherwise commercialize
          any elements of the Ethentic Materials (including, without limitation, any Art) without
          our prior written consent in each case, which consent we may withhold in our sole and
          absolute discretion; and (c) that you will not apply for, register, or otherwise use or
          attempt to use any Ethentic trademarks or service marks, or any confusingly similar marks,
          anywhere in the world without our prior written consent in each case, which consent we may
          withhold at our sole and absolute discretion.

        <p>C. License to Art</p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          i. General Use. Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, Ethentic grants you
          a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license to use, copy, and
          display the Art for your Purchased Pieces, along with any Extensions that you choose to
          create or use, solely for the following purposes: (i) for your own personal,
          non-commercial use; (ii) as part of a marketplace that permits the purchase and sale of
          your Purchased Piece, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each Piece
          owner’s rights to display the Art for their Purchased Piece to ensure that only the actual
          owner can display the Art; or (iii) as part of a third party website or application that
          permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of your Purchased Piece, provided
          that the website/application cryptographically verifies each Piece owner’s rights to
          display the Art for their Purchased Piece to ensure that only the actual owner can display
          the Art, and provided that the Art is no longer visible once the owner of the Purchased
          Piece leaves the website/application.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          ii. Commercial Use. Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, Ethentic grants
          you a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use, copy, and
          display the Art for your Purchased Piece for the purpose of commercializing your own
          merchandise that includes, contains, or consists of the Art for your Purchased Piece
          (“Commercial Use”), provided that such Commercial Use does not result in you earning more
          than One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000 USD) in gross revenue each year. For the sake
          of clarity, nothing in this Section will be deemed to restrict you from (i) owning or
          operating a marketplace that permits the use and sale of Ethentic Pieces generally,
          provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each Piece owner’s rights to
          display the Art for their Purchased Piece to ensure that only the actual owner can display
          the Art; (ii) owning or operating a third party website or application that permits the
          inclusion, involvement, or participation of Ethentic Pieces generally, provided that the
          third party website or application cryptographically verifies each Piece owner’s rights to
          display the Art for their Purchased Piece to ensure that only the actual owner can display
          the Art, and provided that the Art is no longer visible once the owner of the Purchased
          Piece leaves the website/application; or (iii) earning revenue from any of the foregoing,
          even where such revenue is in excess of $100,000 per year.

        <p>D. Restrictions</p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          You agree that you may not, nor permit any third party to do or attempt to do any of the
          foregoing without Ethentic’s express prior written consent in each case: (i) modify the
          Art for your Purchased Piece in any way, including, without limitation, the shapes,
          designs, drawings, attributes, or color schemes (your use of Extensions will not
          constitute a prohibited modification hereunder); (ii) use the Art for your Purchased Piece
          to advertise, market, or sell any third party product or service; (iii) use the Art for
          your Purchased Piece in connection with images, videos, or other forms of media that
          depict hatred, intolerance, violence, cruelty, or anything else that could reasonably be
          found to constitute hate speech or otherwise infringe upon the rights of others; (iv) use
          the Art for your Purchased Piece in movies, videos, or any other forms of media, except to
          the limited extent that such use is expressly permitted in these Terms or solely for your
          own personal, non-commercial use; (v) sell, distribute for commercial gain (including,
          without limitation, giving away in the hopes of eventual commercial gain), or otherwise
          commercialize merchandise that includes, contains, or consists of the Art for your
          Purchased Pieces, except as expressly permitted in these Terms; (vi) attempt to trademark,
          copyright, or otherwise acquire additional intellectual property rights in or to the Art
          for your Purchased Piece; or (vii) otherwise utilize the Art for your Purchased Piece for
          your or any third party’s commercial benefit. To the extent that Art associated with your
          Purchased Piece contains Third Party IP (e.g., licensed intellectual property from a
          celebrity, athlete, or other public figure), you understand and agree as follows: (w) that
          you will not have the right to use such Third Party IP in any way except as incorporated
          in the Art, and subject to the license and restrictions contained herein; (x) that the
          Commercial Use license in Section 3.C(ii) above will not apply; (y) that, depending on the
          nature of the license granted from the owner of the Third Party IP, Ethentic may need to
          pass through additional restrictions on your ability to use the Art; and (z) to the extent
          that Ethentic informs you of such additional restrictions in writing (email is
          permissible), you will be responsible for complying with all such restrictions from the
          date that you receive the notice, and that failure to do so will be deemed a breach of
          this license. The restrictions in this Section will survive the expiration or termination
          of these Terms.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>E. Other Terms of License. </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          The license granted in Section 3.C above applies only to the extent that you continue to
          Own the applicable Purchased Piece. If at any time you sell, trade, donate, give away,
          transfer, or otherwise dispose of your Purchased Piece for any reason, the license granted
          in Section 3.C will immediately expire with respect to that Piece without the requirement
          of notice, and you will have no further rights in or to the Art for that Piece. If you
          exceed the $100,000 limitation on annual gross revenue set forth in Section 3.C(ii) above,
          you will be in breach of these Terms, and must send an email to Ethentic at
          contact@ethentic.art within forty-five (45) days, with the phrase “Ethentic Piece License
          - Commercial Use” in the subject line, requesting a discussion with Ethentic regarding
          entering into a broader license agreement or obtaining an exemption (which may be granted
          or withheld in Ethentic’s sole and absolute discretion). If you exceed the scope of the
          license grant in Section 3.C(ii) without entering into a broader license agreement with or
          obtaining an exemption from Ethentic, you acknowledge and agree that: (i) you are in
          breach of these Terms; (ii) in addition to any remedies that may be available to Ethentic
          at law or in equity, Ethentic may immediately terminate the license that was granted to
          you in Section 3.C, without the requirement of notice; and (iii) you will be responsible
          to reimburse Ethentic for any costs and expenses incurred by Ethentic during the course of
          enforcing these Terms against you.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>F. Feedback.</p>
        <br></br>
        <p>

          submitting any Feedback, you agree that we are free to use such Feedback at our discretion
          and without additional compensation to you, and to disclose such Feedback to third parties
          (whether on a non-confidential basis, or otherwise). You hereby grant us a perpetual,
          irrevocable, nonexclusive, worldwide license under all rights necessary for us to
          incorporate and use your Feedback for any purpose.

          activities prohibited by this Section, we may, at our sole and absolute discretion,
          without notice to you, and without limiting any of our other rights or remedies at law or
          in equity, delete your Ethentic Pieces’ images and descriptions from the SITE. If we

          A. If you elect to purchase or trade Ethentic Pieces, any financial transactions that you
          engage in will be conducted solely through the Ethereum network. We will have no insight
          into or control over these payments or transactions, nor do we have the ability to reverse
          any transactions. With that in mind, we will have no liability to you or to any third
          party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any transactions that you
          engage in, or using the Smart Contracts, or any other transactions that you conduct via
          the Ethereum network.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          B. Ethereum requires the payment of a transaction fee (a “Gas Fee”) for every transaction
          that occurs on the Ethereum network. The Gas Fee funds the network of computers that run
          the decentralized Ethereum network. This means that you will need to pay a Gas Fee for
          each transaction that occurs via the App.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          C. As between us, you will be solely responsible to pay any and all sales, use,
          value-added and other taxes, duties, and assessments (except taxes on our net income) now
          or hereafter claimed or imposed by any governmental authority (collectively, “Taxes”)
          associated with your use of the App (including, without limitation, any Taxes that may
          become payable as the result of your ownership or transfer of any of your Ethentic
          Pieces). Except for income taxes levied on Ethentic, you: (i) will pay or reimburse us for
          all national, federal, state, local or other taxes and assessments of any jurisdiction,
          including value added taxes and taxes as required by international tax treaties, customs
          or other import or export taxes, and amounts levied in lieu thereof based on charges set,
          services performed or payments made hereunder, as are now or hereafter may be imposed
          under the authority of any national, state, local or any other taxing jurisdiction; and
          (ii) shall not be entitled to deduct the amount of any such taxes, duties or assessments
          from payments made to us pursuant to these Terms. You confirm that you are not a resident
          in Canada nor are you registered for Goods and services tax / Harmonized sales tax (GST /
          HST), Quebec sales tax (QST) or Provincial sales taxes (PST) in Canada, and will inform
          Ethentic if your status changes in the future.

          information that is related to your account, and you acknowledge that we will have no
          obligation to maintain any such information in our databases or to forward any such

        <p>You accept and acknowledge each of the following:</p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          A. The prices of blockchain assets are extremely volatile. Fluctuations in the price of
          other digital assets could materially and adversely affect the value of your Ethentic
          Pieces, which may also be subject to significant price volatility. We cannot guarantee
          that any purchasers of Ethentic Pieces will not lose money.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          B. You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your
          Ethentic-related transactions. Ethentic is not responsible for determining the taxes that
          apply to your transactions on the the Site, or the Smart Contracts.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          C. The SITE does not store, send, or receive Ethentic Pieces. This is because Pieces exist
          only by virtue of the ownership record maintained on the SITE’s supporting blockchain in
          the Ethereum network. Any transfer of Pieces occurs within the supporting blockchain in
          the Ethereum network, and not on the SITE.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          D. There are risks associated with using an Internet-based currency, including, but not
          limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious
          software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to
          information stored within your wallet. You accept and acknowledge that Ethentic will not
          be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays
          you may experience when using the Ethereum network, however caused.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          E. A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of distributed
          ecosystems could negatively impact the development of the Ethentic ecosystem, and
          therefore the potential utility or value of Ethentic Pieces.
        </p>{" "}
        <br></br>
        <p>
          F. The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and tokens
          is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the
          development of the Ethentic ecosystem, and therefore the potential utility or value of
          Ethentic Pieces.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          G. Upgrades by Ethereum to the Ethereum platform, a hard fork in the Ethereum platform, or
          a change in how transactions are confirmed on the Ethereum platform may have unintended,
          adverse effects on all blockchains using the ERC-20 standard, including the Ethentic
          ecosystem.

          Please read this Section 15 carefully. It requires you to arbitrate disputes with

          All disputes arising out of or in connection with these Terms, including without
          limitation your access or use of the App, the Site, or the Smart Contracts, or to any
          products sold or distributed through the App, the Site, or the Smart Contracts, will be
          referred to and finally resolved by arbitration under the rules of the International
          Commercial Arbitration Act. The case will be adjudicated by a single arbitrator and will
          be administered by the relevant commercial arbitration centre closest to Ethentic, in
          accordance with its applicable rules. Each party will cover its own fees and costs
          associated with the arbitration proceedings; however, if the arbitrator finds that you
          cannot afford to pay the fees and costs reasonably associated with the arbitration
          proceedings, Ethentic will pay them for you. The place of arbitration will be St. John’s,
          Newfoundland, Canada. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based
          on written submissions. The language of the arbitration will be English. The award of the
          arbitrator will be final and binding, and any judgment on the award rendered by the
          arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the
          foregoing, Ethentic may seek and obtain injunctive relief in any jurisdiction in any court
          of competent jurisdiction, and you agree that these Terms are specifically enforceable by
          Ethentic through injunctive relief and other equitable remedies without proof of monetary

        written. There are no third party beneficiaries to these Terms. The parties are independent
        contractors, and nothing in these Terms create any agency, partnership, or joint venture.

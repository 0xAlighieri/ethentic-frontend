          Causeways was inspired by the Giant's Causeway in County Antrim, Ireland. Both beautiful
          and mysterious, the Giant's Causeway consists of a network of roughly 40,000 basalt column
          that stretch along the Irish coastline.

          The origin of the Giant's Causeway exists both in realms of science and mythology.
          Scientists believe these natural structures occurred as the result of an ancient volcanic
          eruption some 60 million years ago. However, Gaelic mythology tells a much more
          interesting story. According to legend, the Irish giant Finn MacCool was challenged to a
          fight by the Scottish giant Benandonner. The causeway was built to connect the Irish
          coastline with the Scottish Isle of Staffa (where coincidently, similar natural structures
          exist at Fingal's Cave) so that the two giant's could meet one another in battle. In some
          versions of the legend, Finn MacCool defeats Benadonner in battle, and in other versions,
          through some trickery, Finn MacCool convinces the Scottish giant that he is a "giant among
          giants" leading to Benandonner fleeing in fear and destroying the bridge between the Irish
          and Scottish North Channel. Thus, the Giant's Causeway is all the remains of the mythic
          bridge that once connected these two islands.

          The formation of the basalt columns closely follows the centroidal Voronoi tessellation
          (CVT) pattern which can be replicated algorithmically. Thus, the use of CVT as a way to
          programmatically generate three-dimensional structures (as well as the fact that the
          Giant's Causeway is just badass in its own right) served as the basis for the Causeways
          collection.
